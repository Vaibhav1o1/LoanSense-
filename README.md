## 📌 Problem Statement

Banks process thousands of loan applications daily. A false approval
(approving a bad loan) is far more costly than a false rejection.

This project automates loan approval decisions using ML — prioritizing
**Precision** over raw accuracy to minimize financial risk from
false approvals.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Total Records | 1,000 applicants |
| Input Features | 19 features |
| Target Variable | Loan_Approved (Yes / No) |
| Class Distribution | 68.7% Rejected · 31.37% Approved |
| Missing Values | 50 records — handled via imputation |

### 🔑 Key Features

| Feature | Insight |
|---------|---------|
| Credit_Score | Avg: 676 · Strongest predictor of approval |
| DTI_Ratio | Avg: 0.35 · High DTI = lower approval chance |
| Applicant_Income | Avg: $10,852 |
| Loan_Amount | Avg: $20,522 requested |
| Employment_Status | Contract workers had highest approval (37%) |
| Education_Level | Graduates approved more (31.1% vs 25.9%) |

## 🔍 Key EDA Findings

- 📉 **Imbalanced dataset** — only 31.37% approvals (298 out of 950)
- 💳 **Credit Score ≥ 650** was a strong threshold for loan approval
- 💼 **Contract employees** had the highest approval rate at 37.09%
- 🎓 **Graduates** were approved 5.2% more than non-graduates
- 📊 **DTI Ratio & Credit Score** were the top correlated features
  with loan approval (confirmed via correlation heatmap)

## 🤖 Model Comparison

| Model | Key Metric (Precision) | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Logistic Regression | Tested | Baseline model |
| KNN (k=7) | Tested | Weak on high-dim sparse data |
| **Naive Bayes** ✅ | **80.35%** | **Best Precision — selected** |

> 💡 KNN was expected to underperform — with a large number of
> encoded columns, data becomes sparse, reducing KNN's effectiveness.
> This was noted in the code comments before testing.

## 📈 Final Model Performance (Naive Bayes)

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Precision** | **80.35%** |
| **Accuracy** | **86.5%** |
| Train/Test Split | 80% / 20% |
| Test Set Size | 200 records |

> ⚡ **Why Precision?** A False Positive (approving a bad loan) 
> is more costly than a False Negative (rejecting a good one).
> Precision directly measures how many predicted approvals
> were actually correct.
